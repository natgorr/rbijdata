Originally intended to punish and fund the justice system, the use of exorbitant fines and fees has steadily increased over the past decade — often reaching hundreds or thousands of dollars.</p><p>Those who cannot immediately pay face harsh penalties, including arrest, incarceration, license suspensions, additional fees, and even loss of voting rights. These costs block justice-impacted individuals from steady employment and limit employers’ ability to hire. They trap entire families in cycles of poverty and punishment, thwarting economic mobility.</p><p>Eliminating unnecessary, ineffective fines and fees in our justice system strengthens the workforce and helps ensure justice-impacted individuals can continue to work, support their families, and meaningfully contribute to their communities.</p></div></div></section></div></div></body></html>
