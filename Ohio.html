<h3>Ohio: Driver’s License Reform</h3>
<p>RBIJ recruited and engaged businesses — and their leaders — to publicly and privately support legislation that ends debt-based driver’s license suspensions in Ohio by:</p>
<ul><li>Business sign-on letter</li><li>Testimony from seven business leaders in support</li><li>Private advocacy to key legislators</li><li>Op-ed with Phil Petrill (CEO of Hot Chicken Takeover) as byline in the Columbus Dispatch</li></ul>
<p>The bill was signed into law in January 2025 and will help keep Ohioans on the road, gainfully employed, and contributing to society.</p>

<ul><li>Public testimony from local chambers and business leaders</li><li>Private advocacy to key legislators</li></ul>
<p>In December 2024, the bill was signed into law by Governor DeWine, ensuring that individuals can more easily find employment and education opportunities immediately upon their release.</p>
