Bail is the temporary release of a person awaiting trial, often on the condition that money be given to guarantee their appearance in court.</p><p>On any given day, more than <b>600,000</b> Americans are incarcerated in local jails alone. Over the past three decades, the number of annual jail admissions doubled, and the average length of stay increased from <b>14</b> to <b>23</b> days.</p><p>Reforming our bail system will strengthen the economy, improve long-term community safety, and increase justice and equity for our communities.</p></div></div></section></div></div></body></html>
