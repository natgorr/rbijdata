                <h3>Pennsylvania: Clean Slate 3.0</h3>
                <p>RBIJ mobilized businesses — and their leaders — to publicly and privately support legislation relating to Clean Slate by:</p>
                <ul><li>Business sign-on letter</li><li>Testimony from business voices, including the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business & Industry, in support</li><li>Private advocacy to key legislators</li><li><a href="https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/clean-slate-law-pennsylvania-business-employment-20220908.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Op-eds: Gabriel Mandujano (Wash Cycle Laundry), Mike Doner (Flagger Force), Alex Halper (PA Chamber), Abbey Carlton (Indeed)</a></li></ul>
                <p>In December 2023, Governor Josh Shapiro signed PA's Clean Slate expansion bill into law, decreasing waiting periods and expanding eligibility to include individuals with qualifying felonies.</p>
