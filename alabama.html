                Alabama Occupational Licensing
            </p>
            <p>
                RBIJ mobilized businesses — and their leaders — to publicly and privately support legislation that expands access to occupational licensing in Alabama by:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sign-on statement</li>
                <li>Private Advocacy</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In May 2025, Governor Ivey signed this legislation into law, ensuring fairer access to licensed jobs, reduced recidivism, and an expansion of Alabama’s economy.
