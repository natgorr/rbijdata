                <h3>Tennessee: Occupational Licensing</h3>
                <p>RBIJ mobilized businesses — and their leaders — to publicly and privately support legislation that would expand access to occupational licensing in Tennessee by:</p>
                <ul><li>Private advocacy to key legislators</li><li>Public testimony</li></ul>
                <p>In April 2024, HB1859 was signed into law by Governor Lee, ensuring fairer access to licensed jobs, reduced recidivism, and an expansion of Tennessee’s economy.</p>
